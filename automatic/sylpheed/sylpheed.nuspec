    <description>Sylpheed is a simple, lightweight but featureful, and easy-to-use e-mail client. Sylpheed provides intuitive user-interface. Sylpheed is also designed for keyboard-oriented operation, so Sylpheed can be widely used from beginners to power users. Sylpheed runs on many systems such as Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X and other Unix-like systems. Sylpheed uses GTK+ GUI toolkit. The newest version of Sylpheed works with GTK+ 2.4 or later (2.6 or later is recommended). Sylpheed is a free software distributed under the GNU GPL (the library part is GNU LGPL). You can freely use, modify and redistribute it under the license.
